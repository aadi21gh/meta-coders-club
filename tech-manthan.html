      <h2>Event Details</h2>
      <p>Tech Manthan was an exciting and intellectually stimulating event organized by the Meta Coders Club to challenge the logical, analytical, and coding skills of participants. The event was designed to ignite curiosity, teamwork, and technical problem-solving among students through two thrilling rounds: Scan & Seek and Code Cascade.</p>

<p>Round 1: Scan & Seek üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

The first round, Scan & Seek, was a high-octane treasure hunt that combined technology and adventure. Participants raced against time, scanning QR codes, deciphering cryptic clues, and navigating through campus locations to uncover hidden challenges. The round tested their quick thinking, collaboration, and ability to decode logic under pressure. The enthusiasm and energy throughout this round set an electrifying tone for the rest of the event.</p>

<p>Round 2: Code Cascade üíª

The shortlisted teams advanced to Code Cascade, an intense coding round designed to test their algorithmic thinking and programming proficiency. Participants faced a series of logic-based coding puzzles that grew increasingly complex with each stage. The round encouraged problem-solving, debugging skills, and teamwork under a ticking clock, bringing out the best of their coding expertise.</p>
